// The wide mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.
//
// He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But then he meet the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!
//
// When he meets the alligator, the frog makes a tiny mouth.
//
// Your goal in this problem is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by frog. If this one is an alligator (case insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.

function (frog, alligator){

  function mouth_size(){

  };

}

// problem 2:
// Triple Trouble
// Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups.
// Taking the first letter of all of the inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below!
// Ex) Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc"
// Note: You can expect all of the inputs to be the same length.



//PROBLEM: 3
// Consider an array of sheep where some sheep
// may be missing from their place. We need a
// function that counts the number of sheep present
// in the array (true means present).
